# ExampleScripts
A collection of scripts I have written during my undergraduate at The Ohio State University.
In addition to the work here, I have completed tutorials on the following topics:
   MVPA analysis tutorial accompanying Sprague, T.C., Saproo, S. & Serences, J.T. (2015) Visual attention mitigates information loss in small- and large-scale neural codes. Trends in Cognitive Sciences. Tutorial found at http://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/reviews.html. 
   Chapter 1 of Michael A. Nielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". 
   Visionlab Matlab Tutorial from Konkle Lab (cannot find online... add this in a repository?)
   
   Consider sections: "Tutorials", "Modifications made to existing codes", and "Code from Scratch"
